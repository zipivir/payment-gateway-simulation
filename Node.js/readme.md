# Welcome to Node.js boilerplate!

If you've decided to write your simulation in Node.js we just wanted to tell you that you rock!

This boilerplate holds the very basic express server for you to be able to complete your simulation successfully. 

### Installation

Once you've cloned this repo you should first run:

    npm install

### Running the server

In order to run the server should just use the following command: 

    DEBUG=node.js:* npm start

This will start the server on port **3000**.

If everything works fine you should be able to access the `/healthcheck` endpoint and receive the following response:

### Mock server

As part of the simulation there is a mock server that you will have to work against. In order to make sure things are as smooth as possible we've made sure that upon accessing the `/healthcheck` endpoint we're also checking whether the mock server is accessible. If it fails please **contact your interviewer ASAP**.


**Good luck!**
